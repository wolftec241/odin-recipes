basic recipe website

This is the first project in Odin project when I should use the base of html that I learned yet.
In this project I should write a main index page that will have some links to other sites that I will create.
How I said before, I will use just a basic html comments and this sites will not have a beautiful design but in my next projects, after I learn how to use css and js, I will make more beautiful design of sites.
